### Recommendation System

This project is made as a recommendation system API for some social network.  
The service provides a few API methods for getting posts, users and users' recommendations  

There are two similar models which are based on [catboost](https://catboost.ai/). First one is trained with default params and the second one with params optimized.  
A metric is hitrate@5.  

Also, the service provides AB testing for users.
